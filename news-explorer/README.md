# practicum100 (by YANDEX) final project-frontend

The front end of the final project, with authorization and registration handled by the backend server.
you can search news articles (using newsApi- a third party API), save and create a list of saved articles while logged in and delete them or just search while logged out

In this project, I have used React, js, and CSS

* a link to repository with the complete React application which uses this API:
